title: The development server
description: Learn about Mighty's development server, how it works on top of Astro's development server, and how to run it with your specific backend adapter.

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Mighty provides a development server, built on top of Astro's own server to integrate with other backends.

<Aside>
When using Hono, Mighty will run the development server in [**middleware mode**](https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-middlewaremode).

In this case, there is no need to run the server separately.

</Aside>

## How it works

When starting the development server, Mighty:

1. Reads the [Astro config file](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/configuring-astro/#the-astro-config-file) in the project root.
1. Analyzes included integrations, and adds required configuration for UI renderers (e.g. React) and script injections (e.g. Alpine.js).
1. Runs Astro's development server, with custom component rendering middleware included.

In addition, backend adapters may perform additional tasks for better integration, e.g. injecting Astro styles in the `<head>` tag of Blade views (for Laravel).

<Aside type="caution">
Mighty will **not** read Vite config files (e.g. vite.config.js), even those managed by the backend you use.

Mighty runs in a different context than other frameworks, and will not be affected by any changes to these frameworks' bundler configuration.

</Aside>

## Run the development server

To run the development server, refer to the instructions your backend adapter provides:

- [Laravel](/guides/backend-adapters/laravel#run-the-development-server)
- [Hono](/guides/backend-adapters/hono#run-the-development-server)
