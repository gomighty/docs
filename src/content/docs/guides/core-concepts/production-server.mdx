Mighty provides a production server, based on Hono, that renders Astro components on-demand.

<Aside>
When using Hono, Mighty provides helper functions to render Astro components.

In this case, there is no need to run a separate server.

## How it works

Mighty first builds optimized versions of your components through the Astro build process.

Then, when starting the production server, Mighty:

1. Renders the optimized components.
2. Provides necessary logic for UI renderers (e.g. React) and styling to work.

In addition, backend adapters may perform additional tasks for better integration, e.g. injecting Astro styles in the `<head>` tag of Blade views (for Laravel).

## Run the production server

To run the production server, refer to the instructions your backend adapter provides:

- [Laravel](/guides/backend-adapters/laravel#run-the-production-server)
- [Hono](/guides/backend-adapters/hono#run-in-production)
