Mighty is very much a work in progress, and is still feature-incomplete.

Here is a peek at some features we plan to implement.

## Actions

Mighty plans to fully support [Astro Actions](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/actions/).

You will be able to define actions in your backend:

```php {10}
<?php

namespace App\Actions;

use App\Requests\CreatePostRequest;
use Mighty\Attributes\Action;

class CreatePostAction
{
    #[Action('createPost')]
    public function handle(CreatePostRequest $request): void
    {
        Post::create($request->validated());
    }
}
```

... then use them in your Astro components:

```astro
---
import { actions } from "astro:actions";

const result = Astro.getActionResult(actions.createPost);
const inputErrors = isInputError(result?.error) ? result.error.fields : {};
---

<form method="POST" action={actions.createPost}>
  <label>
    E-mail
    <input required type="email" name="email" />
  </label>
  {inputErrors.email && <p>{inputErrors.email}</p>}
</form>
```

## Sessions

Mighty plans to support additional drivers for [Astro Sessions](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/sessions/).

You will be able to write session keys in your backend:

```php title="app/Http/Controllers/PostController.php" {11}
<?php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Models\Post;
use Mighty\MightyResponse;

class PostController extends Controller
{
    public function index(): MightyResponse
    {
        session()->put(['isThisWorking' => true])
        return mighty('posts.index', [
            'posts' => Post:all(),
        ]);
    }
}
```

... then use these keys in your Astro components:

```astro title="resources/astro/pages/posts/index.astro"
---
interface Props {
  posts: { id: number; title: string; content: string }[];
}

const { posts } = Astro.props;

const isThisWorking = await Astro.session?.get("isThisWorking");
---

{isThisWorking && <p>Sessions work!</p>}

<ul>
  {
    posts.map((post) => (
      <li>
        <h2>{post.title}</h2>
        <p>{post.content}</p>
      </li>
    ))
  }
</ul>
```

## SPA Mode

We plan to implement an SPA mode in Mighty, with routing, form handling, and more baked-in.

Mighty will eventually aim to be a drop-in replacement for Inertia.js, with support for more frontend frameworks and deeper integration with the backend.

## File-based Routing

We plan to implement some sort of file-based routing, though we need to iron out the details.
