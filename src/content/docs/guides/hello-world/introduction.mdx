Mighty is a library for building apps with Astro and your favorite backend.

Historically, you could only render Astro components within an Astro project.
In contrast, other web frameworks like React and Vue usually provide a rendering function (e.g. `renderToString`) to use in other contexts.

However, the release of the experimental Container API now makes it possible to render Astro components in any server context.

Mighty builds on top of the Container API to provide a simple way of pairing Astro with the backend of your choice.

## Features

- Render Astro components in any server environment, directly in your project or through a lightweight server.
- Use all your favorite Astro features, including styling, UI framework integrations, and more.
- Hit the ground running using your favorite backend with an available adapter, or create your own.

## Key Principles

Mighty aims to be...

1. **Invisible**: You should feel like you're just using Astro + a backend, with no APIs or additional setup needed.
1. **Easy to try**: Using Mighty in your existing project should be easy, and not conflict with your existing setup.
1. **Feature-rich**: Mighty should provide all the features that make Astro great, including actions, server islands, sessions, and more.
1. **Extensible**: It should be easy to use any backend you'd like, either by using an available adapter or by creating your own.
