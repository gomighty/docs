Ready to take Mighty for a spin?

The easiest way to install Mighty is by using the [`create-mighty`](#install-with-create-mighty) CLI command, which will guide you through the setup process.

If you are using Laravel, a [Laravel starter kit](#laravel-starter-kit) is also available.

## Install with create-mighty

Run the following command in a new or existing project to get started:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<PackageManagerTabs>
  <Fragment slot="npm">
  ```shell
  # create a new project with npm
  npm create mighty@latest
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="pnpm">
  ```shell
  # create a new project with pnpm
  pnpm create mighty@latest
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="bun">
  ```shell
  # create a new project with bun
  bun create mighty@latest
  ```
  </Fragment>
</PackageManagerTabs>

For new projects (if no compatible project is found in the current directory), the `create-mighty` CLI command will prompt you to create a new directory and set up a new project.

For existing Laravel and Hono projects, the `create-mighty` CLI command will install the corresponding adapter and make it possible to run Mighty inside your development environment.

## Laravel starter kit

A Laravel starter kit for Mighty is also available through the Laravel installer.

Make sure [the Laravel installer is available](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/installation#installing-php), then run the command below:

```shell
laravel new my-app --using=gomighty/laravel-starter-kit
```

## Manual setup

To manually set up Mighty, refer to the instructions your backend adapter provides:

- [Laravel](/guides/backend-adapters/laravel#manual-setup)
- [Hono](/guides/backend-adapters/hono#manual-setup)
