There are a multitude of ways to build web applications, each with its strengths and weaknesses.

In this page, we compare Mighty to other similar solutions, showcasing different tradeoffs depending on your use case.

This isn't necessarily a "Mighty vs. X" situation; as you will see, some of these solutions can actually be paired with Mighty to improve developer experience!

<Aside>

  one of them, feel free to contribute to this page by leaving a PR!

## Astro itself

Let's first address the elephant in the room: why not **_just use Astro_?**

While Astro prerenders all pages by default, it can be configured to render pages on-demand on the server, making it a full-stack framework.

Astro's developer experience is fantastic, and depending on your use case, you might just want to build your backend on top of it.

However, there are some limitations in Astro's model:

- Astro is limited to building JavaScript/TypeScript backends, as it is a JavaScript framework.
- To use a backend built in another language, you'll have to build an API to interface with your Astro application.
- You're also bound to Astro's project structure, and all its decisions regarding file-based routing, middleware design, etc.

Of course, these limitations might not matter if your use case fits Astro's model, in which case you might not need Mighty!

But if the above sounds like a dealbreaker, or if you want the freedom to use any backend without fussing around with APIs, Mighty is a great choice.

## Inertia.js

[Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/) allows you to build a modern Single-Page App (SPA) on top of your backend, without having to implement APIs or client-side routing.

In this sense, it's very similar to what Mighty is trying to do, and Inertia.js is in fact a big inspiration for Mighty!

There are some important differences between the two projects:

- Inertia.js is designed for SPAs (be they server- or client-rendered), while Mighty helps you build Multi-Page Apps (MPAs).
- Inertia.js supports [a wide range of backends](https://inertiajs.com/community-adapters), while Mighty currently has official support for Laravel and Hono (for now!).
- Given its MPA nature, Mighty is more deeply integrated with the backend, letting you use backend context (e.g. user info) on the Astro side.

Depending on your requirements, you might opt for Inertia.js to build an interaction-rich SPA app!

You might want to consider Mighty if your app doesn't require fine-grained interactions everywhere, or if you prefer to avoid having a UI framework take over your entire page.

<Aside>
We plan to implement an SPA mode in Mighty, similar to what Inertia.js does!

Mighty will eventually aim to be a drop-in replacement for Inertia.js, with deeper integration with the backend.

## Laravel-specific solutions

### Blade

[Blade](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/blade) is Laravel's built-in, battle-tested, and feature-rich templating engine.

Blade is similar to Astro as it is mainly used to build MPAs, and it can perfectly meet your needs, especially when coupled with a lightweight JavaScript library like [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/).

On the other hand, if you want both Astro's unmatched developer experience on the frontend and Laravel's batteries-included approach, Mighty helps bridge the gap between them.

Mighty can also be used **_alongside_** Blade, with the ability to render Astro components inside your Blade views.

### Livewire

[Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com/) is a full-stack framework for Laravel for building dynamic interfaces in PHP, with no or little JavaScript required.

Livewire builds on top of Blade and Alpine.js to deliver a reactive, SPA-like experience, while Mighty is more geared for building MPAs.

If your use case requires you to build in PHP as much as possible, Livewire is an excellent choice!

Alternatively, if you prefer to leverage Astro's great developer experience, you might want to consider Mighty.

Since Livewire uses Blade, you can use Mighty **_alongside_** Livewire, with the ability to render Astro components inside your Livewire components.

<Aside>
We plan to implement Livewire support inside Astro components!

You will be able to use HTML directives (e.g. `wire:click`) as well as the `$wire` object to interact with Livewire components.

</Aside>

### Mingle.js

- You can use Mighty to do the same thing, now with more frameworks than just React and Vue
- Mingle.js support for Livewire is great
- Livewire support inside of Astro components is planned

### Hybridly

- Hybridly is similar to Inertia.js, but only for Laravel + Vue
- Hybridly puts a big emphasis on end-to-end type safety
- We plan to implement a similar level of type safety in Mighty

### Fusion

- Fusion was a library for combining Laravel and Vue code in the same Single-File Component file:

```vue
<php>
  // Define a prop in PHP
  $name = prop(Auth::user()->name);
</php>

<template>
  <!-- Use it in Vue! -->
  Hello {{ name }}!
</template>
```

- We plan to implement frontend/backend colocation in Mighty
- We might not support backend and frontend code in the same file, as it could lead to confusion

## Hono-specific solutions

### HonoX

<Aside type="caution">
This section may be inaccurate.

If you have experience in HonoX, please feel free to leave a PR and improve this section!

</Aside>

- HonoX is a meta-framework for creating full-stack apps with Hono
- HonoX has support for island hydration, similar to Astro
  - It only officially supports for Hono's JSX runtime and React (with support for writing your own renderer)
- Astro's DX and the JS ecosystem is unmatched when it comes to frontend
- With Astro and Hono, Mighty aims to make the frontend DX even more delightful
