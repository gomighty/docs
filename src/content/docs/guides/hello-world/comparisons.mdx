There are a multitude of ways to build web applications, each with its strengths and weaknesses.

In this page, we compare Mighty to other similar solutions, showcasing different tradeoffs depending on your usecase.

This isn't necessarily a "Mighty vs. X" situation; as you will see, some of these solutions can actually be paired with Mighty to improve developer experience!

## Astro as a full-stack framework

Let's first address the elephant in the room: why not _just use Astro_?

WIP

* Limited to JS/TS backends
* Limited to Astro's structure (file-based routing, middleware, etc.)
* Must design API or use other libraries (e.g. tRPC) to interface with other backends

## Inertia.js

WIP

* Inertia.js was a big inspiration for Mighty!
* Inertia.js is for building SPAs (even when using SSR) while Mighty is for building MPAs
  * Mighty will support an SPA mode in the future
* Mighty is more deeply integrated with the backend through extensible adapters

## Laravel-specific solutions

### Blade

WIP

* Both can be used to build MPAs
* Astro's DX and the JS ecosystem is unmatched when it comes to frontend
* That being said, you can use Mighty with Blade and render Astro components inside of Blade pages!
  * (TODO: support this on launch?)


### Livewire

WIP

* Livewire is for building backend-driven web apps (with SPA-like navigation support) while Mighty is for building MPAs
* Astro's DX and the JS ecosystem is unmatched when it comes to frontend
* Livewire is Blade, so you can use Mighty with Livewire
* Livewire support inside of Astro components is planned


### Mingle.js

WIP

* You can use Mighty to do the same thing, now with more frameworks than just React and Vue
* Mingle.js support for Livewire is great
* Livewire support inside of Astro components is planned
