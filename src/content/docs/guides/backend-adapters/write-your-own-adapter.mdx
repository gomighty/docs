While Mighty provides backend adapters for Laravel and Hono, you might want to use another backend.

Mighty provides a Node.js-based adapter interface, making it easy to add support for your favorite backend.

## Backend adapter building pieces

A backend adapter consists of the following building pieces:

- A way of starting Mighty's development and production servers
- An interface for rendering Astro components from your backend code (usually written in your backend's programming language)
- Additional helper functions and types to improve developer experience (optional, usually written in JS/TS)
