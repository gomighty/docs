Backend adapters are what connect Mighty to your backend framework. They have two main responsibilities:

- Rendering Astro components on your backend.
- Providing backend context (request info, user info, etc.) to your Astro components.

While Mighty's [development server](/guides/core-concepts/development-server) and [production server](/guides/core-concepts/production-server) provide core functionality, adapters are highly specific to the backend you are using.

## Available adapters

We officially support the following backend adapters:

- [Laravel](/guides/backend-adapters/laravel)
- [Hono](/guides/backend-adapters/hono)

## Write your own adapter

If your backend doesn't have an adapter yet, you can write your own!

Mighty provides a unified backend adapter interface, making it easy to implement initial support for other backends, then progressively add features as you go.

Learn how to integrate Mighty with your backend in the [**Write Your Own Adapter**](/guides/backend-adapters/write-your-own-adapter) guide.
