import { Aside, FileTree } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

The Laravel backend adapter integrates Mighty with your Laravel project, allowing you to render Astro components from your controllers or within your Blade/Livewire views.

## Installation

Refer to [the installation guide](/guides/hello-world/installation) to use Mighty in a new project, or an existing one.

[A Laravel starter kit](/guides/hello-world/installation#laravel-starter-kit) for Mighty is also available.

## Getting started

### Project structure

Once you are done setting up Mighty in your Laravel project, you should have the following structure in place:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<FileTree>
- resources
  - astro
    - components
      - Welcome.astro
    - layouts
      - Layout.astro
    - pages
      - **index.astro**
- astro.config.ts
- tsconfig.astro.json
</FileTree>

<Aside type="caution">
Mighty will **only** detect and render Astro components inside the `pages` directory.

Components inside other directories (e.g. `components` and `layouts`) will not be detected, but can be used in components inside the `pages` directory.

</Aside>

### Run the development server

To start the development server, run the following command:

```shell
php artisan mighty:dev
```

This will start a server that renders Astro components on-demand, with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) included for fast updates.

### Start the production server

Before starting the production server, first build optimized versions of your components:

```shell
php artisan mighty:build
```

You can then start the production server with the following command:

```shell
php artisan mighty:start
```

This will start a server that either returns static Astro components or renders them on-demand, depending on your rendering strategy.

<Aside>
You only need to run either the development server or the production server.

When rendering Astro components from Laravel, Mighty will automatically detect which server is running, and serve the appropriate versions of your components.

</Aside>

### Render Astro components from controllers

You can use Astro as a rendering engine for your application by returning Astro components from your controllers.

```php title="app/Http/Controllers/PostController.php" {11-13}
<?php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Models\Post;
use Mighty\MightyResponse;

class PostController extends Controller
{
    public function index(): MightyResponse
    {
        return mighty('posts.index', [
            'posts' => Post:all(),
        ]);
    }
}
```

This will render the following Astro component and pass it the `posts` prop:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<FileTree>
- resources
  - astro
    - pages
      - posts
        - **index.astro**
</FileTree>

You can then use the `posts` prop in your Astro component:

```astro title="resources/astro/pages/posts/index.astro"
---
interface Props {
  posts: { id: number; title: string; content: string }[];
}

const { posts } = Astro.props;
---

<ul>
  {
    posts.map((post) => (
      <li>
        <h2>{post.title}</h2>
        <p>{post.content}</p>
      </li>
    ))
  }
</ul>
```

### Render Astro components inside Blade/Livewire views

You can use Astro inside your Blade/Livewire views, with a syntax similar to rendering Livewire components.

This can be very useful when you need to use UI frameworks for a specific use-case, e.g. React Flow for interactive diagrams.

```blade title="resources/views/index.blade.php" ins={4}
<mighty:posts.index :posts="$posts">
<!-- Or, for short -->
<mighty:posts.index :$posts>
```

This will render the following Astro component and pass it the `posts` prop:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<FileTree>
- resources
  - astro
    - pages
      - posts
        - **index.astro**
</FileTree>

You can then use the `posts` prop in your Astro component:

```astro title="resources/astro/pages/posts/index.astro"
---
interface Props {
  posts: { id: number; title: string; content: string }[];
}

const { posts } = Astro.props;
---

<ul>
  {
    posts.map((post) => (
      <li>
        <h2>{post.title}</h2>
        <p>{post.content}</p>
      </li>
    ))
  }
</ul>
```

### Shared properties

You might want to pass properties to every Astro component, such as the current user or notification content.

To do this, use the `share` method in one of your service providers (typically `AppServiceProvider`):

```php title="AppServiceProvider.php" {22-24}
<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\View;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * Register any application services.
     */
    public function register(): void
    {
        // ...
    }

    /**
     * Bootstrap any application services.
     */
    public function boot(): void
    {
        mighty()->share(fn () => [
            'user' => auth()->user(),
        ]);
    }
}
```

You can use shared properties in your Astro component by using the `shared` function:

```astro
---
import { shared } from "@gomighty/laravel";

const { user } = shared<{ user: { id: number; name: string } | null }>();
---

{user !== null ? `Welcome back, ${user.name}!` : "Please log in!"}
```

<Aside>
  We plan to implement type safety for shared properties, similar to what
  [Hybridly](https://hybridly.dev/) does.
</Aside>

### Routing

<Aside>
We plan to have first-class support for routing inside Astro components.

In the meantime, you can use [Ziggy](https://github.com/tighten/ziggy) or [Laravel Wayfinder](https://github.com/laravel/wayfinder/) to retrieve your Laravel routes and controllers from Astro components.

</Aside>

### Using the Astro render context

You can use Astro render context properties, such as `Astro.request`, just like you would in a standard Astro project.

```astro
---
interface Props {
  posts: { id: number; title: string; content: string }[];
}

const { posts } = Astro.props;

const isBot =
  Astro.request.headers.get("User-Agent")?.startsWith("curl") ?? false;
---

{
  isBot ? (
    <p>Hey, no scraping!</p>
  ) : (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li>
          <h2>{post.title}</h2>
          <p>{post.content}</p>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

### Laravel-specific utilities

<Aside>
  This part is a work in progress, as we add more and more utilities!
</Aside>

In addition to the Astro render context, Mighty provides the following utilities:

- A `user` function for getting the current user:

  ```astro
  ---
  import { user } from "@gomighty/laravel";

  const currentUser = user<{ id: number; name: string } | null>(); // or user('guard')
  ---

  {
    currentUser !== null
      ? `Welcome back, ${currentUser.name}!`
      : "Please log in!"
  }
  ```

- A `session` function to get session info:

  ```astro
  ---
  import { session } from "@gomighty/laravel";

  const { numberOfProductsInCart } = session<{
    numberOfProductsInCart: number;
  }>();
  // or
  const numberOfProductsInCart = session<number>("numberOfProductsInCart");
  ---

  <p>You have {numberOfProductsInCart} products in your cart.</p>
  ```

  <Aside>First-class support for Astro sessions is on the roadmap!</Aside>

- An `errors` function to get validation errors:

  ```astro
  ---
  import { errors } from "@gomighty/laravel";

  const { email: emailError } = errors(); // or errors('errorBag')
  ---

  <form method="POST" action="/profile">
    <label>
      E-mail
      <input required type="email" name="email" />
    </label>
    {emailError && <p>{emailError}</p>}
  </form>
  ```

- A `csrfToken` function and a `<CSRF>` component for form submission:

  ```astro
  ---
  import { csrfToken, CSRF } from "@gomighty/laravel";
  ---

  <form method="POST" action="/profile">
    <input type="hidden" name="_token" value={csrfToken()} />
    <!-- or... -->
    <CSRF />

    <label>
      E-mail
      <input required type="email" name="email" />
    </label>
  </form>
  ```

- A `<Method>` component for form method spoofing:

  ```astro
  ---
  import { CSRF, Method } from "@gomighty/laravel";
  ---

  <form method="POST" action="/profile">
    <CSRF />
    <Method put />

    <label>
      E-mail
      <input required type="email" name="email" />
    </label>
  </form>
  ```
