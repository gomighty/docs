import { Aside, FileTree } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

The Laravel backend adapter integrates Mighty with your Laravel project, allowing you to render Astro components from your controllers or within your Blade/Livewire views.

## Installation

Refer to [the installation guide](/guides/hello-world/installation) to use Mighty in a new project, or an existing one.

[A Laravel starter kit](/guides/hello-world/installation#laravel-starter-kit) for Mighty is also available.

## Getting started

### Project structure

Once you are done setting up Mighty in your Laravel project, you should have the following structure in place:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<FileTree>
- resources
  - astro
    - components
      - Welcome.astro
    - layouts
      - Layout.astro
    - pages
      - index.astro
- astro.config.mjs
</FileTree>

### Start the development server

To start the development server, run the following command:

```shell
php artisan mighty:dev
```

This will start a server that renders Astro components on-demand, with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) included for fast updates.

### Start the production server

Before starting the production server, first build optimized versions of your components:

```shell
php artisan mighty:build
```

You can then start the production server with the following command:

```shell
php artisan mighty:start
```

This will start a server that either returns static Astro components or renders them on-demand, depending on your rendering strategy.

<Aside>
You only need to run either the development server or the production server.

When rendering Astro components from Laravel, Mighty will automatically detect which server is running, and serve the appropriate versions of your components.

### Render Astro components from controllers

You can use Astro as a rendering engine for your application by returning Astro components from your controllers.

```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Models\Post;
use Mighty\MightyResponse;

class PostController extends Controller
{
    public function index(): MightyResponse
    {
        return mighty('posts.index', [
            'posts' => Post:all(),
        ]);
    }
}
```

TODO: explain the `posts.index` syntax
