import { Aside, FileTree } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import PackageManagerTabs from "@/components/PackageManagerTabs.astro";

The Hono backend adapter integrates Mighty with your Hono project, allowing you to render Astro components from your Hono code.

## Installation

Refer to [the installation guide](/guides/hello-world/installation) to use Mighty in a new project, or an existing one.

## Getting started

### Project structure

Once you are done setting up Mighty in your Laravel project, you should have the following structure in place:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<FileTree>
- astro
  - components
    - Welcome.astro
  - layouts
    - Layout.astro
  - pages
    - **index.astro**
  - astro.config.mjs
  - tsconfig.json
</FileTree>

<Aside type="caution">
Mighty will **only** detect and render Astro components inside the `pages` directory.

Components inside other directories (e.g. `components` and `layouts`) will not be detected, but can be used in components inside the `pages` directory.

</Aside>

### Run the development server

You can run the development server by using the `startServer` function:

```ts
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { startServer } from "@gomighty/hono";

const app = new Hono();

app.get("/", (c) => c.text("Hello Mighty!"));

startServer(app);
```

This will start a server that renders Astro components on-demand, with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) included for fast updates.

The server will only start **in development** (i.e. when `NODE_ENV=development`), and the `startServer` function will do nothing in production.

<Aside>
When using Hono, Mighty runs the development server in [**middleware mode**](https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-middlewaremode).

This means the development server is not standalone and will not take up a port.

</Aside>

### Build production assets

Before using Mighty in production, first build optimized versions of your components:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<PackageManagerTabs>
  <Fragment slot="npm">
  ```shell
  # build assets with npm
  npx @gomighty/hono build
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="pnpm">
  ```shell
  # build assets with pnpm
  pnpx @gomighty/hono build
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="bun">
  ```shell
  # build assets with bun
  bunx @gomighty/hono build
  ```
  </Fragment>
</PackageManagerTabs>

Mighty will now use render optimized Astro components either statically or on-demand, depending on your rendering strategy.

<Aside>
  When using Hono, you do not need to run a separate production server.
