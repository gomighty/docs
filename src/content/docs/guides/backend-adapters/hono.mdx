import { Aside, FileTree } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

The Hono backend adapter integrates Mighty with your Hono project, allowing you to render Astro components from your Hono code.

## Installation

Refer to [the installation guide](/guides/hello-world/installation) to use Mighty in a new project, or an existing one.

## Getting started

### Project structure

Once you are done setting up Mighty in your Laravel project, you should have the following structure in place:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<FileTree>
- astro
  - components
    - Welcome.astro
  - layouts
    - Layout.astro
  - pages
    - **index.astro**
  - astro.config.mjs
  - tsconfig.json
</FileTree>

<Aside type="caution">
Mighty will **only** detect and render Astro components inside the `pages` directory.

Components inside other directories (e.g. `components` and `layouts`) will not be detected, but can be used in components inside the `pages` directory.

</Aside>

### Run the Mighty server

TODO

```ts
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { runMightyServer } from "@mighty/hono";

const app = new Hono();

app.get("/", (c) => c.text("Hello Mighty!"));

runMightyServer(app); // TODO: only do something if NODE_ENV=development?
```

## Manual setup

<Aside>Check back later for instructions on setting up Mighty manually!</Aside>
