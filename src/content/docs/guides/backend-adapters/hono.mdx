import { Aside, FileTree } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import PackageManagerTabs from "@/components/PackageManagerTabs.astro";

The Hono backend adapter integrates Mighty with your Hono project, allowing you to render Astro components from your Hono code.

## Installation

Refer to [the installation guide](/guides/hello-world/installation) to use Mighty in a new project, or an existing one.

## Getting started

### Project structure

Once you are done setting up Mighty in your Hono project, you should have the following structure in place:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<FileTree>
- astro
  - components
    - Welcome.astro
  - layouts
    - Layout.astro
  - pages
    - **index.astro**
  - astro.config.mjs
  - tsconfig.json
</FileTree>

<Aside type="caution">
Mighty will **only** detect and render Astro components inside the `pages` directory.

Components inside other directories (e.g. `components` and `layouts`) will not be detected, but can be used in components inside the `pages` directory.

</Aside>

### Run the development server

You can run the development server by using the `startServer` function:

```ts {8}
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { startServer } from "@gomighty/hono";

const app = new Hono();

// ...

startServer(app);
```

This will start a server that renders Astro components on-demand, with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) included for fast updates.

The server will only start **in development** (i.e. when `NODE_ENV=development`), and the `startServer` function will do nothing in production.

<Aside>
When using Hono, Mighty runs the development server in [**middleware mode**](https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-middlewaremode).

This means the development server is not standalone and will not take up a port.

</Aside>

### Build production assets

Before using Mighty in production, first build optimized versions of your components:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<PackageManagerTabs>
  <Fragment slot="npm">
  ```shell
  # build assets with npm
  npx @gomighty/hono build
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="pnpm">
  ```shell
  # build assets with pnpm
  pnpx @gomighty/hono build
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="bun">
  ```shell
  # build assets with bun
  bunx @gomighty/hono build
  ```
  </Fragment>
</PackageManagerTabs>

Mighty will now use render optimized Astro components either statically or on-demand, depending on your rendering strategy.

<Aside>
  When using Hono, you do not need to run a separate production server.

### Render Astro components from Hono code

You can use Astro as a rendering engine for your application by returning Astro components from your Hono code.

```ts {7-10}
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { db } from "./lib/db";
import { startServer, render } from "@gomighty/hono";

const app = new Hono();

app.get("/", async (c) => {
  const posts = await db.getPosts();
  return render(c, "posts.index", { posts });
});

startServer(app);
```

This will render the following Astro component and pass it the `posts` prop:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<FileTree>
- astro
  - pages
    - posts
      - **index.astro**
</FileTree>

You can then use the `posts` prop in your Astro component:

```astro title="resources/astro/pages/posts/index.astro"
---
interface Props {
  posts: { id: number; title: string; content: string }[];
}

const { posts } = Astro.props;
---

<ul>
  {
    posts.map((post) => (
      <li>
        <h2>{post.title}</h2>
        <p>{post.content}</p>
      </li>
    ))
  }
</ul>
```

### Shared properties

You might want to pass properties to every Astro component, such as the current user or notification content.

To do this, use the `share` function in your Hono code:

```ts
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { db } from "./lib/db";
import { startServer, render, share } from "@gomighty/hono";

const app = new Hono();

app.get("/", async (c) => {
  const posts = await db.getPosts();
  return render(c, "posts.index", { posts });
});

startServer(app);

share(app, async (c) => {
  return {
    user: db.getUser(),
  };
});
```

You can use shared properties in your Astro component by using the `shared` function:

```astro
---
import { shared } from "@gomighty/hono";

const { user } = shared<{ user: { id: number; name: string } | undefined }>();
---

{user ? `Welcome back, ${user.name}!` : "Please log in!"}
```

### Using the Astro render context

You can use Astro render context properties, such as `Astro.request`, just like you would in a standard Astro project.

```astro
---
interface Props {
  posts: { id: number; title: string; content: string }[];
}

const { posts } = Astro.props;

const isBot =
  Astro.request.headers.get("User-Agent")?.startsWith("curl") ?? false;
---

{
  isBot ? (
    <p>Hey, no scraping!</p>
  ) : (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li>
          <h2>{post.title}</h2>
          <p>{post.content}</p>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```
